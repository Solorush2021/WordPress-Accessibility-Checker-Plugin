# **App Name**: Access Assistant

## Core Features:

- Accessibility Meta Box: Display the accessibility check results and suggestions in a dedicated meta box within the WordPress post editor.
- Accessibility Analysis: Analyze post content for common accessibility issues, such as missing alt text, insufficient color contrast, and improper heading structure, using the Gemini API as a tool.
- Issue Highlighting: Highlight detected accessibility issues within the post content preview using visual cues, such as colored underlines or icons.
- Accessibility Score: Display a summary score or rating representing the overall accessibility level of the post content.
- API Key Configuration: Allow users to configure the Gemini API key directly within the plugin settings page in WordPress.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#673AB7) with a subtle glassmorphism effect to convey professionalism and trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) with a frosted glass appearance for a clean and unobtrusive admin interface.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF8A65) with a translucent layer to highlight interactive elements and call-to-actions, creating a vibrant, accessible feel.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for clear, accessible readability in both headings and body text. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use simple, recognizable icons with a slightly blurred edge to represent different types of accessibility issues (e.g., an image icon for missing alt text), fitting the liquid glass aesthetic.
- Ensure the meta box layout is clean, intuitive, and responsive across various screen sizes, with a focus on maintaining the glassmorphism effect's consistency.
